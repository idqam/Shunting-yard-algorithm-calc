# Shunting-yard-algorithm-calc
Implements the Shunting-yard algorithm and then does basic arithmetic on the user-input. Basic support for numbers. 
GenDoubleLinked, GenNodes, GenQueue, and GenStack are generic-based implementations of a doubly-linked list, a nodes class, a queue , and a stack. 
The InfixCalculator.java file implements the shunting-yard algortihm for convering from infix to postfix notation.

Example: " 4 + 5 " is converted to " 4 5 + " and then this expression is evaluated in the Calculator.java file.

Calculator.java file asks the user for some input and then prins the output in postfix notation and the result of the arithmetic expression.
